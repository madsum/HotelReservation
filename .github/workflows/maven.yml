      # The project is in a subdirectory, so we need to run the command from the root
      # and specify the pom file path.

    # Note: If Testcontainers were used, this workflow would need a setup step
    # to ensure Docker is available on the runner. Since we reverted to H2,
    # the standard build command is sufficient.
